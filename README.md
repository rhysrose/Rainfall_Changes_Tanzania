﻿# Project: **Climate Change Analysis in Tanzania**

## Objective:
- Analyzing historical climate data to understand trends and predict future climate patterns in Tanzania.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Scikit-learn (for Machine Learning)

- Streamlit (for deployment)

## Project Structure:
### 1. Data Collection:
- *Source*: Use publicly available climate datasets (e.g., NOAA, World Bank Climate Data) that include historical weather patterns in Tanzania.

- Download and integrate the data to a csv file that you can use further for the analysis.

- Data Format: CSV or Excel files are commonly available formats.

- Output: Downloaded dataset in a structured format ready for preprocessing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
Tasks:

- Handle missing values (if any).

- Convert data types as necessary (e.g., datetime conversion).

- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features such as seasonal trends, average temperatures, precipitation levels.

- Encoding categorical variables (if applicable).

- Output: Cleaned dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Tasks:

- Statistical summaries: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance).

- Data visualization: Plot time series of temperature trends, precipitation levels over the years.

- Identify correlations: Heatmaps, scatter plots to understand relationships between variables.

- Seasonal decomposition: Identify seasonal patterns using decomposition techniques (e.g., using seasonal_decompose from statsmodels).

- Output: Visualizations (line plots, histograms, heatmaps) depicting historical climate trends and patterns.

### 4. Machine Learning Model Development:
##### Objective: Predict future climate conditions based on historical data.

Tasks:

- Split data into training and testing sets.

- Select appropriate ML model(s) (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) for prediction.

- Train the model on historical data.

- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

- Output: Trained model capable of predicting future climate conditions in Tanzania.

### 5. Streamlit Deployment:
#### Objective: Create an interactive web application to showcase climate predictions.

Tasks:

- Develop a Streamlit app with user-friendly interface.

- Incorporate visualizations (e.g., plots from EDA, predicted climate trends).

- Allow users to input parameters (if applicable) and see model predictions in real-time.

- Output: Deployed Streamlit web application accessible for users to explore climate predictions.

## Project Deliverables:
- Final Report: Document summarizing the project objectives, methodology, findings from EDA, and model performance. This will be a blog outlining what you have learnt in the course - You can further post it in social media to higlight what you have done.

- Code: Python scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, model development, and Streamlit app deployment.

- Streamlit Web App: Live deployment link for interactive exploration of climate predictions.

## Conclusion:
This project will equip you with essential skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and deploying a web application using Streamlit. It leverages freely available climate data to gain insights into climate change patterns specific to Tanzania. Adjustments can be made based on specific datasets you find during your exploration.# Rainfall_Changes_Tanzania
